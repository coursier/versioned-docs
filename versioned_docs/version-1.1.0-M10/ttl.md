Changing things in cache are given a time-to-live (TTL) of **24 hours** by default. Changing things are artifacts for versions ending with `-SNAPSHOT`, Maven metadata files listing available versions, etc.

The most straightforward way of changing that consists in setting `COURSIER_TTL` in the environment. It's parsed with `scala.concurrent.duration.Duration`, so that things like `24 hours`, `5 min`, `10s`, or `0s`, are fine, and it accepts infinity (`Inf`) as a duration.

```tut:invisible
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration

Duration("24 hours")
Duration("5 min")
Duration("10s")
Duration("0s")
Duration("Inf")
```
